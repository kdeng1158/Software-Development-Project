## Team Members 
Paige Burns, Kalvin Deng, Maria Garcia Fraile, Evan Ketellapper, John Le

## What features were completed?
> - The features that were completed were the front end (HTML) of the following pages:
> > - Create New Account
> > - Login
> > - My Profile
> > - Expenses
> > - Resources
> > - NavBar

## What worked during the demo?
> - The following features worked during the demo:
> > - Login
> > - Create New Account
> > - Expenses
> > - Resources
> > - Profile Page
> > > - 'delete account' & 'change your profile' modals
> > - NavBar icons are linked correctly to its corresponding pages

## What issues were faced either during the development or during the demo?
> - During the development process, the issue that we faced was the styling of certain pages, but we were able to clean it up before the demo.
> - During the demo, there were only minor issues such as the navbar not resizing with a resized page, small styling details such as not removing the 'forgot password' on the Sign-up page, and one of the navbar icons not showing up correctly.

## What were the suggestions offered by the TA?
> - He suggested (for the prediction page) that we should work from the front end backwards, which means that we should figure out what we need first then start some front end then go into the back end.
> - Another suggestion is to just use javascript instead of trying to go into c++ and the other complicated languages.
> - For the NavBar resizing issue, he suggested that we specify the absolute padding, and one way to 'debug' this problem was to use the 'inspect' to view the page on different screen sizing and to use the other features there to help find the problem.
> - For the resources, he recommends creating a seperate table to store the links/descriptions.
> > - Start with something that works, so use the examples from lab7.
> - For the password, he said to just store it plain text for now and worry about encoding it later.
> - He also suggested creating a db diagram then it will convert to what code we need
