# Project Milestone 6

## Project Description
 Budget Buddy is aimed at helping college students and young professionals budget their life. This application will include several features, including a spending and income log and an educational element to teach the young audience about investing and other financial management tasks. 

Users will be able to easily log every expense they have into the software. They will be able to categorize their expenses to see where they spend the bulk of their money and where they might need to budget. They will also be able to log their income in the app to be able to notice if they are living above their means (spending more than they make) or not. There will be several visualization tools such as tables and graphs that will help users visualize their spending habits and detect patterns for where they could reduce their spending. Users will then be able to implement a budget goal within the application (ex. “I will spend $200 a month on groceries”) and track their expenses to stay below their set budget.

The last feature of the application will be an educational feature. This part will hold information on how users will be able to start using more financial management tools and smartly invest and save their money for their futures. This will include information on starting a user’s 401k, Roth IRA, investing in stocks, etc. There will be information in the application as well as links to other sites, tutorials, classes, and companies that can help users begin their financial journey.

## Individual Contributions

> ### Kalvin Deng
- Throughout the project, I was responsible for developing the front and back end of the login and create new account pages. The main languages I used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I utilized passport and user session to manage identity access management to ensure users are capable of gaining access to their down data. After coding up the access management parts of the code, I was able to tell my teammates how to filter their SQL queries to only include the data for whichever user was logged in.
